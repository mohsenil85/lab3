Lab 3 Report
Scheme

1.  Given input of '(3 1 4 1 9 5), the function f returns (4 2 5 2 10 6).  
2.  The function f takes a list of numbers as an arguement and adds 1 to each member 
of the list.
3.  ;  the following line is an if statement. in scheme, if statments have the 
    ; following structure:  (if (test) (then-br) (else-br)).  null? tests if the argument is 
    ; null or not.  If it is null, the statment will return the the (then-br) expression.  
    ; if it is false, it will return the (else-br) expression.
4.  ;  The following line is a literal null or false in scheme.  it is used to bottom 
    ; out the recursion.
5.  ;  the following line takes the first element of a list and adds one to it, and then 
    ; conses it onto the tail of the list, which tail itself the function f is applied 
    ; to recursively.  in other words, it maps " + 1" to the list.
